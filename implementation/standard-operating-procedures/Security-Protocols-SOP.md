// Authentication check middleware
export const requireAuth = async (
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
  next: () => void
) => {
  try {
    const { userId } = await getAuth(req);
    if (!userId) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
    }
    req.auth = { userId };
    return next();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Auth error:', error);
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
};

// Authorization check
export const requireRole = (allowedRoles: string[]) => async (
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
  next: () => void
) => {
  try {
    const { userId } = req.auth;
    const user = await getUserWithRoles(userId);
    
    if (!user || !user.roles.some(role => allowedRoles.includes(role))) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
    }
    
    return next();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Role check error:', error);
