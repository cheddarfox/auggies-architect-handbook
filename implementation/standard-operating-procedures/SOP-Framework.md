# WTFB Standard Operating Procedures Framework

This document establishes the framework for creating, maintaining, and enforcing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) across all WTFB projects and processes.

> **Purpose:** To ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency across all WTFB operations through standardized processes that are well-documented, regularly updated, and consistently followed.

## 1. SOP Principles

All WTFB SOPs should adhere to these core principles:

- **Clarity:** Written in clear, concise language that is easily understood
- **Completeness:** Covering all necessary steps and considerations
- **Consistency:** Following a standardized format and approach
- **Practicality:** Designed to be actually followed, not just documented
- **Accessibility:** Easily accessible to all team members
- **Maintainability:** Structured for easy updates and revisions
- **Accountability:** Including clear ownership and responsibilities

## 2. SOP Categories

WTFB SOPs are organized into the following categories:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Development | Code-related processes | Git workflow, coding standards, testing |
| Infrastructure | System and environment processes | Server setup, deployment, monitoring |
| Project Management | Planning and coordination processes | Sprint planning, backlog management |
| Documentation | Documentation processes | Technical docs, user guides, API docs |
| Security | Security-related processes | Access control, vulnerability management |
| Quality Assurance | Quality control processes | Code reviews, testing protocols |

## 3. SOP Structure

All SOPs should follow this standard structure:

1. **Title:** Clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Git/GitHub Workflow SOP")
2. **Purpose:** Brief statement of why this SOP exists
3. **Scope:** What the SOP covers and doesn't cover
4. **Roles & Responsibilities:** Who is responsible for what
5. **Prerequisites:** What needs to be in place before following this SOP
6. **Procedure:** Step-by-step instructions, clearly numbered
7. **Verification:** How to verify the procedure was followed correctly
8. **Exceptions:** When the SOP might not apply or might be modified
9. **Related Documents:** Links to related SOPs or resources
10. **Revision History:** Record of changes to the SOP

## 4. SOP Creation Process

1. **Identify Need:** Recognize a process that needs standardization
2. **Draft SOP:** Create initial draft following the standard structure
3. **Review:** Have relevant team members review the draft
4. **Revise:** Update based on feedback
5. **Approve:** Get formal approval from appropriate stakeholders
6. **Publish:** Make the SOP available in Confluence
7. **Announce:** Communicate the new SOP to the team
8. **Train:** Provide any necessary training on the new procedure

## 5. SOP Maintenance

1. **Regular Review:** Review each SOP at least quarterly
2. **Feedback Collection:** Continuously collect feedback on SOP effectiveness
3. **Update Process:** Follow the same process as creation for updates
4. **Version Control:** Maintain clear version history in Confluence
5. **Archiving:** Archive obsolete SOPs rather than deleting them

## 6. SOP Enforcement

To ensure SOPs are consistently followed:

- **Checklists:** Create checklists for complex procedures
- **Automation:** Automate compliance checks where possible
- **Integration:** Integrate SOPs into tools and workflows
- **Reviews:** Include SOP compliance in code and process reviews
- **Metrics:** Track adherence to SOPs through appropriate metrics
- **Continuous Improvement:** Use feedback to improve both the SOPs and the enforcement mechanisms

## 7. SOP Template

```markdown
# [Title of SOP]

## Purpose
[Brief statement of why this SOP exists]

## Scope
[What the SOP covers and doesn't cover]

## Roles & Responsibilities
[Who is responsible for what]

## Prerequisites
[What needs to be in place before following this SOP]

## Procedure
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
   a. [Sub-step a]
   b. [Sub-step b]
4. [Step 4]

## Verification
[How to verify the procedure was followed correctly]

## Exceptions
[When the SOP might not apply or might be modified]

## Related Documents
[Links to related SOPs or resources]

## Revision History
| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0 | YYYY-MM-DD | [Name] | Initial version |
```

## 8. Priority SOPs for Development

The following SOPs should be created as priorities:

1. Git/GitHub Workflow (Already created)
2. Development Environment Setup
3. Code Review Process
4. Testing Standards and Procedures
5. Deployment Process
6. Documentation Standards
7. Issue/Bug Tracking Process
8. Security Protocols

> **Note:** This framework follows the "round table" philosophy where every team member has both the responsibility to follow SOPs and the authority to suggest improvements to them.
