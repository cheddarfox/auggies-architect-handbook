# WTFB Code Review Process SOP

## Purpose
This document establishes standard procedures for conducting code reviews in WTFB projects to ensure code quality, knowledge sharing, and consistent implementation of best practices across the team.

## Scope
This SOP covers the entire code review process, including preparation, submission, review criteria, feedback, and approval. It applies to all code changes in WTFB repositories, regardless of size or complexity.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Authors:** Prepare code for review, respond to feedback, and make necessary changes
- **Reviewers:** Evaluate code against established criteria and provide constructive feedback
- **ARCHitects (including Auggie):** Conduct architectural reviews and resolve complex disagreements
- **Project Leads:** Ensure code reviews are being conducted properly and address systemic issues

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of WTFB coding standards and best practices
- Access to the repository and pull request system
- Familiarity with the codebase being modified

## Procedure

### 1. Preparation for Code Review

#### 1.1 Code Quality Checks
1. **Before Submitting for Review:**
   - Ensure code passes all linting rules
   - Verify all tests pass locally
   - Check for any obvious bugs or edge cases
   - Review your own code first

2. **Self-Review Checklist:**
   - Does the code accomplish the intended purpose?
   - Is the code as simple as possible?
   - Are there any unnecessary abstractions or premature optimizations?
   - Are there any hardcoded values that should be configurable?
   - Is error handling comprehensive and appropriate?

#### 1.2 Pull Request Preparation
1. **Create a Focused Pull Request:**
   - Keep PRs small and focused on a single concern
   - Aim for PRs under 400 lines of code when possible
   - Split large changes into multiple PRs when appropriate

2. **PR Description Requirements:**
   - Clear summary of changes
   - Link to related issue(s)
   - Implementation details and design decisions
   - Testing approach
   - Screenshots or videos for UI changes
   - Any specific areas where feedback is requested

3. **Example PR Description:**
   ```markdown
   ## Description
   Implements user profile editing functionality.

   ## Related Issues
   Fixes WTFB-123

   ## Implementation Details
   - Added ProfileEditForm component with validation
   - Created API endpoint for profile updates
   - Added authorization checks to ensure users can only edit their own profiles
   - Implemented optimistic UI updates

   ## Testing
   - Added unit tests for form validation
   - Added integration tests for API endpoint
   - Manually tested across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

   ## Screenshots
   [Before/After screenshots]

   ## Specific Feedback Requested
   I'm particularly interested in feedback on the form validation approach.

### 2. Code Review Process

#### 2.1 Review Assignment
1. **Required Reviewers:**
   - At least one reviewer with domain expertise
   - For significant changes, include an ARCHitect
   - For security-sensitive changes, include a security-focused reviewer

2. **Review Timeframe:**
   - Initial review should be completed within 1 business day
   - Follow-up reviews should be completed within 4 business hours

#### 2.2 Review Criteria
1. **Functionality:**
   - Does the code work as intended?
   - Are all requirements addressed?
   - Are edge cases handled appropriately?

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Does the code follow WTFB coding standards?
   - Is the code readable and maintainable?
   - Are functions and variables named clearly and consistently?
   - Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
   - Is there appropriate error handling?

3. **Architecture:**
   - Does the code follow established architectural patterns?
   - Are concerns properly separated?
   - Are abstractions at the appropriate level?
   - Is the code extensible for future requirements?

4. **Performance:**
   - Are there any obvious performance issues?
   - Are database queries optimized?
   - Are there any unnecessary computations or renders?

5. **Security:**
   - Is user input properly validated and sanitized?
   - Are authentication and authorization checks in place?
   - Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?

6. **Testing:**
   - Are there appropriate tests for the changes?
   - Do the tests cover edge cases?
   - Are tests clear and maintainable?

7. **Documentation:**
   - Is the code adequately commented where necessary?
   - Are complex algorithms or business rules explained?
   - Is user-facing documentation updated if applicable?

#### 2.3 Review Comments
1. **Comment Guidelines:**
   - Be specific and actionable
   - Explain the "why" behind suggestions
   - Differentiate between required changes and suggestions
   - Use a constructive and respectful tone
   - Include code examples when helpful

2. **Comment Categories:**
   - **Blocking:** Must be addressed before approval
   - **Non-blocking:** Suggestions that can be addressed in a follow-up PR
   - **Question:** Seeking clarification
   - **Praise:** Highlighting good practices

3. **Example Comments:**
   - Blocking: "This query doesn't include a limit, which could lead to performance issues with large datasets. Please add pagination."
   - Non-blocking: "Consider extracting this logic into a separate utility function for reusability."
   - Question: "Why was this approach chosen over [alternative]?"
   - Praise: "Great job implementing this complex algorithm in a readable way!"

### 3. Responding to Review Feedback

#### 3.1 Author Responsibilities
1. **Addressing Comments:**
   - Respond to all comments
   - Make requested changes or explain why changes weren't made
   - Mark comments as resolved when addressed

2. **Handling Disagreements:**
   - Provide rationale for your approach
   - Be open to alternative perspectives
   - Focus on technical merits rather than personal preferences
   - Escalate to an ARCHitect if consensus cannot be reached

#### 3.2 Follow-up Reviews
1. **Incremental Reviews:**
   - Reviewers should focus on changes made since the last review
   - Verify that previous concerns have been addressed
   - Avoid introducing new concerns unless critical

2. **Review Completion:**
   - Reviewers should explicitly approve the PR when satisfied
   - Authors should request re-review when changes are complete

### 4. Approval and Merging

#### 4.1 Approval Requirements
1. **Standard Changes:**
   - At least one approval from a qualified reviewer
   - All blocking comments resolved
   - CI/CD checks passing

2. **Critical Changes:**
   - At least two approvals, including one from an ARCHitect
   - All comments resolved
   - CI/CD checks passing
   - Verification in a staging environment

#### 4.2 Merging Process
1. **Pre-Merge Checklist:**
   - Required approvals obtained
   - CI/CD checks passing

   - No merge conflicts

2. **Merge Responsibility:**
   - The author is responsible for merging after approval

   - Ensure the squashed commit message is descriptive

3. **Post-Merge Actions:**
   - Delete the branch after merging
   - Verify deployment if applicable
   - Update related issues/tickets

### 5. Continuous Improvement

   - Time to first review
   - Time to approval
   - Number of review cycles
   - Types of issues found

2. **Team Retrospectives:**
   - Discuss code review process in sprint retrospectives
   - Identify patterns in review comments
   - Update standards based on recurring issues

#### 5.2 Learning from Reviews
1. **Knowledge Sharing:**
   - Use code reviews as learning opportunities
   - Document common issues and solutions
   - Share best practices identified during reviews

## Verification
- All code changes are reviewed according to the process
- Review comments are constructive and actionable
- Required approvals are obtained before merging
- Code quality improves over time

## Exceptions
- Critical hotfixes may follow an expedited review process with post-implementation review
- Trivial changes (e.g., typo fixes) may require less rigorous review
