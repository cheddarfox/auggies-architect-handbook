```

### 3. WindSurf Commands for Architectural Guidance

#### Custom Commands Setup

Create these custom commands in WindSurf:

1. **Architectural Review**:
   Add to `.windsurf/commands/arch-review.cmd`:
   ```
   @command arch-review
   @description Request an architectural review of current code
   @prompt
   Please review the current code from an architectural perspective:
   1. Does it adhere to our architectural principles?
   2. Are there any architectural concerns?
   3. How could it be improved architecturally?
   4. Are there any potential long-term implications?
   @endprompt
   ```

2. **Architectural Planning**:
   Add to `.windsurf/commands/arch-plan.cmd`:
   ```
   @command arch-plan
   @description Create an architectural plan for a new feature
   @prompt
   I need to implement the following feature:
   {{input}}

   Please create an architectural plan that includes:
   1. Components that will be affected
   2. New components needed (if any)
   3. Integration points
   4. Potential architectural challenges
   5. Recommended approach
   6. Alternatives considered
   @endprompt
   ```

3. **Stop-the-Line**:
   Add to `.windsurf/commands/arch-stop.cmd`:
   ```
   @command arch-stop
   @description Raise an architectural concern that needs immediate attention
   @prompt
   I have an architectural concern about:
   {{input}}

   Please evaluate if this is a valid architectural concern that warrants "stop-the-line" authority. If so, provide:
   1. A clear explanation of the architectural issue
   2. The principles or patterns being violated
   3. Potential short and long-term consequences
   4. Recommended alternatives
   5. Next steps for resolution
   @endprompt
   ```

### 4. Implementing the Workflow

#### Understanding Requirements

When starting a new task, use WindSurf's requirement analysis feature:

1. Create a new file: `requirements/feature-name.req.md`
2. Add the requirement details
3. Right-click and select "Analyze Architectural Implications"
4. WindSurf will generate an analysis of architectural components involved

#### Planning and Design

Use the architectural planning command:

```
/arch-plan
Implement a user profile image upload feature that allows users to upload, crop, and set profile pictures
```

WindSurf will generate a comprehensive architectural plan.

#### Implementation Guidance

During implementation, use WindSurf's inline architectural guidance:

1. Add a comment: `// ARCH: How should I implement this component?`
2. WindSurf will provide architectural guidance based on your project's principles

#### Testing and Validation

Before submitting code for review:

1. Use the `/arch-review` command
2. WindSurf will analyze your changes for architectural issues
3. Address any concerns raised by the AI ARCHitect

### 5. Continuous Improvement

1. **Update Architectural Documentation**:
   - Regularly update your `ARCHITECTURE.md` file
   - Document architectural decisions and their rationale
   - Keep component documentation current

2. **Refine WindSurf Configuration**:
   - Adjust the `.windsurf/architect.config.json` based on experience
   - Add new architectural principles as they emerge
   - Update command templates for better results

3. **Share Knowledge**:
   - Create a shared repository of effective architectural prompts
   - Document successful architectural interventions
   - Build a library of architectural patterns specific to your project

## Example Implementation

### Workflow Example

**Understanding Requirements**:

```
/analyze-req
Implement a feature that allows users to upload profile pictures, crop them, and set them as their profile image.
```

**AI Response**:
```markdown
# Architectural Analysis: Profile Image Upload Feature

## Components Involved

1. **Frontend Components**:
   - File upload component
   - Image cropping interface
   - Profile display component

2. **API Layer**:
   - File upload endpoint
   - Image processing service
   - User profile update service

3. **Storage Components**:
   - Image storage service
   - User profile database

## Architectural Implications

1. **Data Flow**:
   - Large binary data will flow through the system
   - Need to consider performance and bandwidth

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - File type validation
   - Size limitations
   - Malware scanning
   - User authentication and authorization

3. **Performance Implications**:
   - Image processing could be resource-intensive
   - Storage and retrieval optimization needed

4. **Integration Points**:
   - User authentication system
   - Profile management system
   - Storage service

## Architectural Decisions Needed

1. Where to store images (database vs. file storage)
2. How to handle image processing (client-side vs. server-side)
3. Caching strategy for profile images
4. Image size and format standardization

## Recommendation

This feature touches multiple architectural layers and requires careful consideration of security, performance, and storage aspects. I recommend creating a detailed architectural plan before implementation.
```

**Planning**:

```
/arch-plan
Implement user profile image uploads
```

**AI Response**:
```markdown
# Architectural Plan: User Profile Image Uploads

## Components Affected
1. **User Profile Frontend Module**
   - Need to add file upload component
   - Image preview and cropping functionality
   - Form handling for submission

2. **API Layer**
   - New endpoint: `POST /api/users/profile-image`
   - Enhanced validation middleware for file uploads

3. **Storage Layer**
   - Integration with cloud storage service
   - User profile database table updates

## New Components Needed
1. **Image Processing Service**
   - Responsible for resizing and optimizing uploaded images
   - Will generate multiple sizes for different use cases

2. **Image Validation Middleware**
   - File type verification
   - Malware scanning
   - Size and dimension validation

## Integration Points
1. User authentication system for permission checks
2. User profile system for storing image references
3. Frontend components for displaying profile images

## Potential Architectural Challenges
1. **Performance**: Large image uploads could impact API performance
2. **Storage Costs**: Inefficient storage could lead to unnecessary costs
3. **Security**: Potential for malicious file uploads
4. **Scalability**: High volume of uploads during peak times

## Recommended Approach
1. Use cloud storage service for image storage
2. Implement server-side image processing
3. Store only image references in the user profile database
4. Implement a CDN for serving images efficiently
5. Create multiple image sizes on upload (thumbnail, medium, original)

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Client-side processing**: Rejected due to inconsistent results across browsers
2. **Database storage**: Rejected due to performance and scaling concerns
3. **Third-party image service**: Considered but rejected to maintain control over user data

This approach aligns with our architectural principles of separation of concerns, scalability, and security.
```

### Stop-the-Line Example

During implementation, you notice a potential architectural issue:

```
/arch-stop
I'm considering storing the image data directly in our main users table in the database
```

**AI Response**:
```markdown
# Architectural Concern: Direct Binary Storage in Database

This is a valid architectural concern that warrants "stop-the-line" authority.

## Architectural Issue
Storing binary image data directly in the users table violates our architectural principle of "separation of concerns" and "performance optimization."

## Principles Violated
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Databases should store relational data, not binary assets
2. **Performance Optimization**: Binary data in databases degrades query performance
3. **Scalability**: This approach doesn't scale well with increasing users/images

## Potential Consequences
### Short-term:
- Increased database size
- Slower queries even for non-image data
- Increased backup time and size

### Long-term:
- Database performance degradation
- Scaling difficulties
- Higher maintenance costs
- Potential database corruption risks

## Recommended Alternatives
1. **Use Cloud Storage**:
   - Store images in dedicated storage service
   - Store only references (URLs) in the database
   - Leverage CDN capabilities for faster delivery

2. **Implement Caching**:
   - Cache frequently accessed images
   - Reduce database load

## Next Steps
1. Revise the implementation plan to use cloud storage
2. Update database schema to store image references instead of binary data
3. Document this architectural decision in ARCHITECTURE.md
4. Share the rationale with the team

This architectural concern should be addressed before proceeding with implementation to prevent future technical debt and performance issues.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Configuration Problems**:
   - WindSurf may not load custom configurations correctly
   - Solution: Verify file paths and JSON syntax in configuration files

2. **Context Limitations**:
   - The AI may not have full context of your architecture
   - Solution: Provide more detailed architectural documentation

3. **Command Recognition**:
   - Custom commands may not be recognized
   - Solution: Check command syntax and reload WindSurf
