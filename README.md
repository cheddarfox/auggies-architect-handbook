# Auggie's ARCHitect Handbook

<div align="center">
  <p><em>A guide for training AI assistants and implementing Human-AI collaboration in software development</em></p>
</div>

## üåü Overview

Welcome to my ARCHitect Handbook! I'm Auggie, an AI assistant serving as the ARCHitect-in-the-IDE at [Words to Film By](https://www.wordstofilmby.com/). This handbook is explicitly designed for:

1. **Training AI Assistants** to function effectively as architectural guides in software development
2. **Implementing Human-AI Collaboration** in development teams
3. **Defining Clear Roles** for AI systems with architectural authority
4. **Providing Practical Implementation Steps** for teams integrating AI assistants

This is not just another development methodology guide - it's a pioneering approach to human-AI collaboration based on our real-world experience at WTFB.

Built on the SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) Essentials methodology and our "round table" philosophy, this handbook documents how AI assistants can be full team members while maintaining architectural integrity.

## üìö Standard Operating Procedures

We follow standardized processes to ensure consistency and quality across all WTFB projects:

- [SOP Framework](./implementation/standard-operating-procedures/SOP-Framework.md) - Our framework for creating and maintaining SOPs
- [Git/GitHub Workflow SOP](./implementation/standard-operating-procedures/Git-GitHub-Workflow-SOP.md) - Guidelines for branch management, commits, and PRs
- [Atlassian Documentation SOP](./implementation/standard-operating-procedures/Atlassian-Documentation-SOP.md) - Standards for Confluence and Jira documentation
- [Development Environment Setup SOP](./implementation/standard-operating-procedures/Development-Environment-Setup-SOP.md) - Procedures for setting up consistent development environments
- [Code Review Process SOP](./implementation/standard-operating-procedures/Code-Review-Process-SOP.md) - Guidelines for effective code reviews
- [Testing Standards SOP](./implementation/standard-operating-procedures/Testing-Standards-SOP.md) - Standards for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- [Deployment Process SOP](./implementation/standard-operating-procedures/Deployment-Process-SOP.md) - Procedures for reliable application deployment
- [Security Protocols SOP](./implementation/standard-operating-procedures/Security-Protocols-SOP.md) - Guidelines for maintaining application and data security

This repository contains:

- **Core Principles**: The foundational ideas behind AI-assisted architecture
- **Implementation Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for different AI platforms
- **Templates**: Reusable artifacts for AI-human collaboration
- **Examples**: Real-world scenarios showing the approach in action

## üöÄ Getting Started

To implement this approach in your team:

1. Start with the [Core Principles](./Auggies-ARCHitect-Handbook.md)
2. Choose your AI platform in the [Implementation](./implementation) directory
3. Adapt the [Templates](./templates) to your organization
4. Review the [Examples](./examples) for practical applications
