# Example: Clerk Authentication Fix

This example demonstrates the SAFe Essentials workflow in action, showing how we addressed an authentication error in our Clerk implementation.

## The Issue

During deployment to Vercel, the build was failing with the following error:

```
Failed to compile.

./components/wrapper/auth-wrapper.tsx:94:7
Type error: Type '{ children: Element[]; publishableKey: string; signInUrl: string; signUpUrl: string; signInFallbackRedirectUrl: string; afterSignInUrl: string; afterSignUpUrl: string; appearance: { ...; }; onError: (err: any) => void; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & Without<NextClerkProviderProps, "__unstable_invokeMiddlewareOnAuthStateChange">'.
  Property 'onError' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & Without<NextClerkProviderProps, "__unstable_invokeMiddlewareOnAuthStateChange">'.
```

## The Workflow

### 1. Understanding Requirements

We analyzed the error message and determined that:
- The `onError` property was not supported by the `NextClerkProviderProps` type
- We needed to maintain error handling functionality
- The solution needed to be compatible with Clerk's API

### 2. Planning and Design

We considered several approaches:
- Removing error handling entirely (rejected due to loss of functionality)
- Using a different Clerk API (rejected due to lack of documentation)
- Implementing a global error event listener (selected as best approach)

We planned to:
1. Remove the unsupported `onError` prop
2. Add a global error event listener for Clerk-related errors
3. Ensure proper React hooks ordering

### 3. Implementation

We made targeted changes to the `auth-wrapper.tsx` file:
- Removed the `onError` prop from the `ClerkProvider` component
- Added a global error event listener to catch Clerk-related errors
- Ensured all hooks were placed at the top level of the component

### 4. Testing

We thoroughly tested the changes:
- Ran the application locally to verify it worked
- Checked for console errors
- Ran a full build to verify it would pass in production
- Verified error handling still functioned correctly

### 5. Validation

We validated that:
- The build completed successfully
- Error handling functionality was preserved
- No new issues were introduced
- The implementation aligned with the requirements

### 6. Collaboration

We created a detailed PR with:
- A clear overview of the issue and solution
- Technical details about the implementation
- Testing information
- Impact assessment
- Links to related issues

### 7. Continuous Improvement

We identified learnings:
- The importance of checking API compatibility
- The value of thorough testing, including full builds
- The need to follow React's rules of hooks carefully

## The Solution

The solution replaced the direct `onError` prop with a global error event listener that checks for Clerk-related errors and handles them appropriately, while ensuring proper hook ordering.

## Files Changed

- `components/wrapper/auth-wrapper.tsx`

## Results

- The build now completes successfully
- Error handling functionality is preserved
- The application works correctly in production

This example demonstrates how following the SAFe Essentials workflow leads to methodical problem-solving and high-quality solutions.
